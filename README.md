AquariumExhibit
===============

This is a mobile application developed by Marvin Jimenez and Wilbert Ramos 
for the Software-Hardware CoDesign course offered at Florida Atlantic University 
on the Spring of 2014. 
Disclaimer: We do not own some of the images that are included in this project. 
We only used them temporarily to provide a visual representation of the fish
while the artists create original drafts.
