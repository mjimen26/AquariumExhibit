    <string name="angelfish_desc">The Pygmy Angelfish is also called the Cherubfish, 
        Cherub Angelfish, or Atlantic Pygmy Angelfish. It is a brilliant 
        sapphire-blue with orange highlights to the face.\n\n
		The Pygmy Angelfish requires a 55 gallon or larger tank with numerous 
		hiding places and live rock for grazing on microalgae. It may nip at 
		large-polyped stony corals and clam mantles.\n\n
		The Pygmy Angelfish is an aggressive little angelfish, so it is best to 
		never have more than one male per tank, since they may fight to the death. 
		A breeding pair may be kept, and the Pygmy Angelfish has been bred in an 
		aquarium with success.\n\n
		The diet of the Pygmy Angelfish should include Spirulina, marine algae, 
		high-quality angelfish preparations, mysis or frozen shrimp, and other meaty 
		items. Feed three times daily. \n\n\n</string>
